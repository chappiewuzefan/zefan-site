I finally wrapped my CV workflow into a GitHub-hosted site, so it felt like the perfect time to start jotting down a few notes.

What you can expect here:

- Short write-ups about backend work, production learnings, and GCP adventures.
- Metadata on keeping IoT fleets healthy (things that never make it into the resume line-items).
- Maybe the occasional personal project log when something fun ships.

Thanks for reading! If you spot anything broken or want to say hi, the message board on the resume page is always open.
